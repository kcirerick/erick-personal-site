In January 2023, I decided that my goal for the year would be to build my first \'decoupled dollar\', meaning my first dollar that isn\'t directly coupled with the amount of time that I spent on it. Naturally, the best way I could think to do this is to build an online business around my talents and interests. Right now, that means trying to push out useful blogs, tutorials, and tools related to all things AI, Data Infra, and Entrepreneurship, along with some musings on other topics as well.',
